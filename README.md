# py_downloadsorganizer
A simple Windows python file organizer that organizes the downloads folder since i can never seem to find what i need on there. <br>
A python interpreter is needed to run the program since i dont know how to compile it into an executable (maybe kinda obvious)

# How to use:
*this program is quite still not really polished so it might change.*

## Change user
- Simply change where it says "USER" to your user folder name, if you wish to use it else where just change the directory (working on how to do that within the program)
 
## Extentions (might change soon):
- The **"file_exts"** variable lies the available file extentions ordered by type that the program will organize into their respective folders

## Folders
- The program will make specific folders for each type of file, for example: **"Images"**, **"Apps"** or **"Others"** <br> The names of the folders lie on the **"folder_names"** variable.

### All this is subject to change as i learn more about python but in all this was a silly project i wanted to make.
